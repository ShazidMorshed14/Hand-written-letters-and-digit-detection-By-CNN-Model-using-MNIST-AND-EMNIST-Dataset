# Hand-written-letters-and-digit-detection-By-CNN-Model-using-MNIST-AND-EMNIST-Dataset
This is a Project of Deep Neural Network (CNN) . What classifies hand written digits and letters.

CNN model capable of classify hand written digits and letters .
Models are trained and tested with 

MNIST dataset (for digit detection)
and EMNIST BALANCE DATASET (for both letter and digit detection)
link of these datasets are given into the zip file provided in this respirotory.
